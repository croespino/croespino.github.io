I really enjoy writing computer programs; and I especially enjoy writing programs that do the greatest good, in some sense.

My mission is to make people's lives better with quality software engineering. Writing software is an activity I'll hardly stop doing even if I no longer dedicate myself to it professionally. I also do it for fun.

I'm a Software Engineer in Seattle, WA. I began my career in Durango, Mexico, and since I have been lucky to have had a wide range of experience working with the development of complex software in teams, both large and small, in Mexico and the United States.

My full name is Carlo Eduardo Rodriguez Espino.
