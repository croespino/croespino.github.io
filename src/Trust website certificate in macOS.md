title: Trust website certificate in macOS

Valid use cases I came across for doing this:
1. Enabling HTTPS for router's LAN web access.

- Browse to the website in Safari.
- There will be a prompt alert about the website's certificate.
- Click on "Show certificate".
- Drag and drop the certificate icon and place it somewhere in your computer.
- Double-click the certificate to add it to the System's Keychain.
- Search for the certificate in the Keychain Access app.
- Expand the Trust section and mark everything as "Always Trust".
