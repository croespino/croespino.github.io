- `-` - negates during search, e.g., `<search> -in:#<channel-name>`.
    - The above example is equivalent to search for `<search>` **not** in the channel `<channel-name>`.
- `/color <user-alias> <html-color-code>` - set the `<user-alias>` color to the color `<html-color-code>`, e.g., `/color @croespino #639FB6`.
