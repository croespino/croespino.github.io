## About me

Hi there, my name is Carlo. I think coding is a skill, and software development is an art. I also think coding is compared to writing in many ways, like rewriting is the best writing; the coding equivalent of refactoring, or like cut out the clutter; the coding equivalent of keeping it simple, and others.

My goal with software engineering is to serve people with quality software. Whether it is to help them find their next vacation flight or rating video lessons on a training platform, I think software is a way to serve, people getting value from the software I helped develop. This feeling, I get it magnified when millions of people use the software daily.

I live in Seattle, WA, and began my career in Mexico. I've been lucky to have had a wide range of experience helping develop complex software, in small and large teams, in Mexico and the United States. My full name is Carlo Eduardo Rodriguez Espino, and I prefer to keep it simple as Carlo Espino.
