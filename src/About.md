## About me

Hi, my name is Carlo. I think coding is a skill and software development is an art. I also think coding is compared to writing in many ways, for example, rewriting is the best writing; the coding equivalent of refactoring, or cutting out the clutter; the coding equivalent of keeping it simple, and others.

My mission with software development is to serve people with quality software. Whether it is to help them travel or learn on a training platform, I think software is a way to serve. I get this feeling magnified when millions of people get value from the software I powered to create and maintain.

I live in Seattle, Washington, and began my career in Mexico. I've been lucky to have experience with the development of complex software, in small and large teams, in the United States and Mexico. My full name is Carlo Eduardo Rodriguez Espino, and I prefer to keep it simple as Carlo Espino.
