<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I really enjoy writing computer programs; and I especially enjoy writing programs that do the greatest good, in some sense.</p>
<p>My mission is to make people's lives better with quality software engineering. Writing software is an activity I'll hardly stop doing even if I no longer dedicate myself to it professionally. I also do it for fun.</p>
<p>I'm a Software Engineer in Seattle, WA. I began my career in Durango, Mexico, and since I have been lucky to have had a wide range of experience working with the development of complex software in teams, both large and small, in Mexico and the United States.</p>
<p>My full name is Carlo Eduardo Rodriguez Espino.</p>
